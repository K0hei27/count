(A) For better or worse, there is no doubt that English is now a world language. It is also of course a rapidly changing one, and no one can predict how it will develop. It seems likely, however, that there will be movement in two directions: on the one hand, towards greater standardization of English used as a shared means of communication in international contexts; and on the other, towards varieties of English which are only used, or understood, within particular countries or communities.

(B) The function of the nursery school is not to be a substitute for an absent mother, but to supplement and extend the role which in the child's earliest years the mother alone plays. The nursery school is probably most correctly considered as an extension 'upwards' of the family, rather than an extension downwards' of the primary school. It seems desirable, therefore, before discussing in any detail the role of the nursery school and of the teacher in particular, to set down a summary of what the infant needs from the mother, and the nature of the role that the mother plays in fostering healthy psychological development in the child's earliest years. It is only in the light of the mother's role and the child's needs that a real understanding can be gained of the way in which the nursery school can continue the mother's work.
