(A) Some people still persist in a view of the natural world and its inhabitants as having no other value than to serve humans as tools, objects, and resources. This approach is very different from that of indigenous people who recognize no such hierarchy and do not see a separating wall between humans and the animal and plant kingdoms. They regard all creatures of the earth as fellow travelers and spiritual teachers.

(B) A legacy of humans' evolutionary past is the fact that extensive brain development occurs after a child is born. Other creatures have genetic inheritance that includes a specialized body and mind fitted to a specific environment, but humans have a brain that grows while exposed to the environment. Brain development and the environment interact. A child is born with an ability to grasp complex patterns and learn from a wide number of possible environments. Interaction with the environment shapes a child's brain, narrowing its learning potential to fit the actual community in which the child lives.
