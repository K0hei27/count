(A) Scientists and animal trainers have devoted their lives to trying to understand what the world looks like to animals. After all, the planet is full of perceptive creatures-of whom we are a small minority-and it's more than a matter of idle curiosity to consider how life appears to them. Humans can't help approaching this problem from a human perspective. We posit our own intelligence, our behavior, emotions, and language skills, as the norm. A horse-trainer friend of mine is often asked if horses are intelligent. "It depends who's writing the test," he likes to say.

(B) Communication is far more than speech and writing. Most of us are unaware that we are communicating in many different ways even when we are not speaking.
