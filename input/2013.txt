(A) The fundamental reason why exceptional creativity and genius tend to elude institutional training is that they arise from many elements, such as motivation and personality, whereas schools, colleges, and universities focus chiefly on only one element: intelligence. Whatever intelligence consists of-and there is still no consensus after a century of intelligence testing-it does not appear to be the same as creativity. Intellectual skills and artistic creativity surely do not mutually exclude each other, but neither do they necessarily accompany each other.

(B)	Like Galileo, Newton stressed the importance of comparing theories and models with experiments and observations of the real world, and always carried out relevant experiments himself, whenever possible to test his ideas. This is so deeply ingrained as part of the scientific method today that it may seem obvious, even to non-scientists, and it is hard to appreciate the extent to which, even into the seventeenth century, many philosophers would speculate about the nature of the physical world in an abstract way, without ever getting their hands dirty in experiments. The classic example is the argument about whether two different weights dropped from the same height at the same time would hit the ground together.
