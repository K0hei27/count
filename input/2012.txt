(A) Culture is not something in opposition to biology; rather, culture is the form that biology takes in different communities. One culture may differ from another culture, but there are limits to the differences. Each must be an expression of the underlying biological commonality of the human species. There could not be a long-term conflict between nature and culture, for if there were, nature would always win: culture would always lose.

(B) What is cinema and what is a film? A mere hundred years old, the cinema has-in its different manifestations-become at once so obvious and so ubiquitous that one hardly appreciates just how strange a phenomenon it actually is. Not only an extraordinary entertainment medium, a superb story-telling machine, it also gives a kind of presence and immediacy to the world unparalleled elsewhere, and undreamt of before the cinema was invented. Nothing else seems to give such intense feelings: nothing involves people so directly and tangibly in the world out there and in the lives of others
