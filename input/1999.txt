(A) A prudent employer would take the time to analyze the incentives workers might list as their reasons for working-and most importantly, the order in which they list them. A recent study disclosed that money was number seven on such a list. Topping it was satisfaction in performing the job. Obviously, that good feeling one gets from having accomplished something is still the best reward for hard labor. But workers also need to know they are doing their job well, and the major deficiency within management today is the failure of telling them so.

(B) It is good when someone speaks out about an issue that troubles a group, because then it can-must-be faced. I know from experience that the habit of avoiding controversy can in the end cause far more trouble than it avoids, because strong feelings, unexpressed, don't die but build up. They can accumulate other resentments that might otherwise be unimportant. In the end, if we are not to be possessed by hidden ill-feeling, we have to listen to one another.
