(A) It was language that, for the first time, enabled our ancestors to teach others, including their children, about objects and events that were not actually present. There are other intelligent animals living today with complex brains and elaborate communication systems, but they cannot, so far as we know, do that. Chimpanzees and other apes can be taught many of the signs of American Sign Language, ASL. They have acquired three hundred or more, and can use them in new contexts and with each other as well as their trainers. But they did not, during their evolution, develop the uniquely human ability to talk about that which is not present, share events of the distant past, plan for the far-off future, and, most important, discuss ideas exchanging them to share the accumulated wisdom of an entire group.

(B) Any adult who interacts with a child, any traveler who visits other cultural groups, any historian who studies beliefs and attitudes of the past immediately becomes aware that others might not interpret the world as she or he does. Even peers from the same culture are confronted with these issues, such as when communication fails or when one person misunderstands another. When we make such observations, we often say the others have different concepts from us; this sort of statement is especially common in discussions of children.
