(A)  In December 1877, Thomas Edison made history by recording 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' on his phonograph and playing it back. This was not just 'an epoch in the history of science', it was a revolution for the human voice. Before then, hearing someone talk was exclusively a live experience: you had to be listening as the sounds emerged from the speaker's mouth. We can read the text of great speeches that predate the phonograph, like Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, but how exactly the president delivered the lines is lost forever. The phonograph captured the way things are said, and this can be just as important as the words themselves. When someone says 'I'm all right', the tone of their voice might in fact tell you they are not all right.

(B) In recent years, study after study examining exercise and weight loss among people and animals has concluded that, by itself, exercise is not an effective way to drop pounds. In most of these experiments, the participants lost far less weight than would have been expected, mathematically, given how many additional calories they were burning with their workouts. Scientists involved in this research have suspected and sometimes shown that exercisers, whatever their species, tend to become hungrier and consume more calories after physical activity.
