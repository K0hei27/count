(A) The mass media, printed and broadcast, are probably the most pervasive influences on attitudes and opinions in the modern world. Access to mass media is, in fact, one of the defining characteristics of modernity. Other, more powerful forces may exist within a given region or culture. On a global basis, however, in terms of sheer numbers reached, other forms of communication cannot compete with the words and pictures carried in newspapers, broadcasts, magazines, and advertising. For example, the ways women are presented in the mass media strongly affect people's notions on woman place, as it is and as it ought to be.


(B) Any grouping of human beings has its own world: a certain range of knowledge and certain modes of evaluation. Such a worldview is subject to constant modification as time rolls on. Nor can its association with the particular grouping prevent it from being adopted, to a greater or a lesser extent, by members of some other grouping. On the contrary, information, tastes, habits, modes of feeling and judgement can be transmitted from one sociocultural grouping to another, and individuals can in any case have loyalties to more than one grouping, so that they themselves are mobile between different worldviews accordingly.
