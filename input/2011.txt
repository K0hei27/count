(A) Silence is an act of nonverbal communication that transmits many kinds of meaning dependent on cultural norms of interpretation. Our tendency to describe silence as an absence of speech reveals a particular cultural bias, implying that something is missing, but silence is a "something" with purpose and significance. Silent behavior occurs in all societies, although its message various both between and within different groups. It conveys meaning, as does all communication, partly from the situational and interactional contexts of its use. Emphasizing the "use" of silence also focuses on the fact that silence does not simply exist but is actively created by participants.

(B) Freedom of the mind requires not only, or not especially, the absence of legal constraints but the presence of alternative thoughts. The most successful tyranny is not the one that uses force to assure uniformity but the one that removes the awareness of other possibilities, that makes it seem inconceivable that other ways are viable, that removes the sense that there is an outside. It is not feelings or commitments that will render a man free, but thoughts, reasoned thoughts.
