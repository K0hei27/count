(A) Of the total energy produced on Earth since the industrial revolution began, half has been consumed in the last twenty years. Disproportionately it was consumed by us in the rich world; we are an exceedingly privileged fraction.
Today it takes the average citizen of Tanzania almost a year to produce the same volume of carbon emissions as is effortlessly generated every two and a half days by a European, or every twenty-eight hours by an American. We are, in short, able to live as we do because we use resources at hundreds of times the rate of most of the planet's other citizens.

(B) Humor is the broad term used to describe situations, characters, speech, writing or images that amuse us. At the physical level, it is no more than an involuntary response to a stimulus-laughter. Although we can imitate this in social contexts where we feel an obligation to be polite, genuine laughter comes upon us spontaneously: it is beyond our control. It may be a motor response, but we seek out experiences that will result in laughter, and if we don't get the physical reaction, we don't feel that we have been amused.
