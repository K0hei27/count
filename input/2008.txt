(A) When Takanori Shibata first began robotic research 14 years ago, he wasn't interested in inventing a robot to help with jobs around the house. He wanted to design something that would improve the quality of people's lives. Shibata thought about animals and how they enriched the lives of the people who interact with them.

As Shibata studied the interplay between animals and humans, he learned how pets have positive psychological and social effects on people, and began focusing on that aspect. In addition to cheering people up, domesticated animals can reduce stress and encourage communication in humans, particularly people who suffer mental and physical problems. He decided to design a therapeutic robot, one that would be unfamiliar, yet lovable. In 1998, he created Paro, modeled after a baby harp seal.

(B) How we handle our own feelings of impatience, hostility, and anger is a far more powerful example to our children than what we tell them to do with theirs. We don't want to impose our black moods on our children, but neither do we want to pretend that our angry feelings don't exist. In any case, we may as well be honest, for even when we try to cover up our anger, our children sense how we feel.
