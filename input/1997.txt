(A) Why do mothers instinctively hold babies on their left side? One theory was that it was a matter of convenience-mothers need their right hand free to feed the baby. Others thought it had something to do with the greater sensitivity of the left breast. But now, says a medical magazine, doctors have found the answer: mothers cradle on the left because it leaves the baby's left ear exposed. The left ear feeds information to the right side of the baby's brain, the side which interprets the melody and emotional sound quality of the mother's voice.

(B) Home is where the heart is. But at the same time, home is so sad. Bland's attitude towards his flat was the somewhat shifting point at which these two attitudes met. When he was away from it he thought of it longingly, as the place which would always provide him with a refuge from the world. When he was actually inside it, safe and warm and quiet, as he had always wished to be, it irritated him, precisely on account of those same qualities for which he had felt such intense nostalgia. The quietness, which he cherished, tormented him. There seemed to be no way in which he could resolve the conflict between these feelings.
