The good news is that the individual components of your brain cells are constantly renewed so that no part of them is actually likely to be more than about a month old. Indeed, it has been suggested that there isn't a single bit of any of us that was part of us nine years ago. It may not feel like it, but at the cellular level we are all youngsters.
