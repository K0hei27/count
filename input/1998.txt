(A) Reading is not a passive act. Good writing of any kind will invite you to participate, engaging your senses, emotions, imagination, and intellect. It will trigger your own memories and associations, and it will stimulate your thinking. When you read, you absorb, evaluate, and extend what the writer has articulated, interpreting it in light of who you are and what you know. In this sense, when you read a work of literature, you recreate it.

(B) Human cultures evolve differently under varying circumstances, just as biological systems do. From one culture to another, different attitudes about human relationships with nature-about the degree to which human beings are part of or separate from nature-prevail, and different assumptions arise concerning the roles human beings play in the natural order.
