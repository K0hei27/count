(A) Growing older is an activity we are familiar with from an early age. In our younger years upcoming birthdays are anticipated with a glee that somewhat diminishes as the years progress. Our younger selves feel that time moves slowly, whereas, with advancing years, time seems to fly at ever-quickening pace. And late in life, or when a person is faced with a terminal illness no matter what their age, the sense of a finite amount of time remaining becomes acute, and there may be a renewed focus on making the most of one's allotted time in life.

(B) Culture is the location of values, and the study of cultures shows how values vary from one society to another, or from one historical moment to the next. 

But culture does not exist in the abstract. On the contrary, it is inscribed in the paintings, operas, fashions, and shopping lists which are the currency of both aesthetic and everyday exchange. Societies invest these artefacts with meanings, until in many cases the meanings are so "obvious" that they pass for nature. Cultural criticism denaturalizes and defamiliarizes these meanings, isolating them for inspection and analysis.
