(A) Lectures on videotape, on audiotape and - if delivered from detailed, antique notes-even in the lecture hall, come closer to the way knowledge is stored in books or on the Internet than to the manner in which it can be created and obtained through open questions and collaboration. As a method of conveying information, lectures lack the speed and the free-ranging exploration typical of computer access to data. The information they contain is rarely the reason for our interest in them; the source of their fascination is the eloquence and angle of vision of the lecturer. What makes such presentations worthwhile is the opportunity they afford of seeing, and asking questions about, how another human being perceives the world.

In traffic signs, green, the color of nature and harmony, is used as the opposite of red to mean 'safe to go'. Perhaps because we associate darkness and the night' with death, clothes at funerals are black to acknowledge mourning, whereas at carnivals we put together as many bright, primary colors as possible.
